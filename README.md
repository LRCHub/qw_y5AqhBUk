[00:00.32] Why do I go and make things so complicated?
[00:03.91] I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else
[00:06.56] Gettin' me frustrated
[00:08.16] And life's like this you
[00:09.85] And you fall, and you crawl, and you break, and you take what you get
[00:12.61] And you turn it into
[00:14.37] Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fakin'
[00:17.62] No, oh
[00:20.62] 
[00:37.59] Why do I have so many glitches?
[00:41.03] The more that you're sweet, the more I'm suspicious
[00:45.82] Every time that you speak, there's a formula hidden
[00:49.97] It ain't 'bout what you said, it's more what you didn't
[01:17.47] 
[00:55.39] Somebody else, somebody else
[01:00.00] Somebody else, somebody else
[01:04.31] Somebody else 'round everyone else
[01:06.62] You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
[01:08.82] You try to be cool
[01:09.90] You look like a fool to me
[01:22.90] 
[01:13.59] Why do I go and make things so complicated?
[01:16.86] I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else
[01:19.36] Gettin' me frustrated
[01:21.24] And life's like this you
[01:22.91] And you fall, and you crawl, and you break, and you take what you get
[01:25.77] And you turn it into
[01:27.41] Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fakin'
[01:30.42] No, oh
[01:33.42] 
[01:50.94] Why do I have such an obsession
[01:54.14] With matchin' your words with all your expressions?
[01:58.71] Every time that you talk it's like I'm bein' tested
[02:03.45] If it's true, how come you looked away when you said it?
[02:31.45] 
[02:08.68] Somebody else, somebody else
[02:12.93] Somebody else, somebody else
[02:17.66] Somebody else 'round everyone else
[02:19.85] You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
[02:21.99] You try to be cool
[02:23.13] You look like a fool to me
[02:36.13] 
[02:26.96] Chill out, what you yellin' for?
[02:29.17] Lay back, it's all been done before
[02:31.35] And if you could only let it be
[02:34.86] You would see
[02:36.10] I like you the way you are
[02:38.37] When we're drivin' in your car
[02:40.43] And you're talkin' to me
[02:42.70] One on one, but you become
[02:55.70] 
[02:47.37] Why do I go and make things so complicated?
[02:50.55] I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else
[02:53.42] Gettin' me frustrated
[02:55.10] And life's like this you
[02:56.75] And you fall, and you crawl, and you break, and you take what you get
[02:59.51] And you turn it into
[03:01.17] Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fakin'
[03:04.41] No, oh (oh)
